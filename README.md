# PythonGameProject-CS3100

This project was written in Python using the open source game engine Ursina Engine. This engine is still being worked on daily, and at the time
of our project it was still in its infancy. Because of this, I got to dig deep into the source files of the engine, change them to fit our project,
and create new source files as seen in the enemy.py. Our game we developed was a mario clone, and while there were still some issues with the final product,
we learned a lot about game dev and open source development.
